        <p>
          I graduated from Mechatronics Engineering from the University of
          Waterloo in 2023. Iâ€™ve had five great internships where I've gained
          experience building full-stack applications, from developing modern
          online learning experiences, implementing web accessibility standards
          on desktop and mobile and most recently building design tools at
          Twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm looking to bring my skills and passion for learning to a full-time
          opportunity where I can continue to grow professionally.
