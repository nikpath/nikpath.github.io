          I graduated from Mechatronics Engineering from the University of
          Waterloo in 2023. Iâ€™ve had five great internships where I've gained
          experience building full-stack applications and working with a variety
          of languages and frameworks. I'm looking to bring my skills and
          passion for learning to a full-time opportunity where I can grow as a
          software engineer.

        <p>Currently seeking full-time opportunities.</p>
